1.3 Experiment Details

Unit of diversion is per advertiser
Unit of Analysis is per campaign
Assumptions:

1) each advertiser and campaign are independent;

2) each advertiser only has 1 campaign during the experiment (If in reality one advertiser can have multiple campaigns then we need to do more nuanced analyses, e.g. bootstrap);

3) no other factors affects the overspend results besides the new product. The effects not calibrated with other tested features.
